Overall comments on grading questions:

1) Does your site make the information easy to find?
    - Better than the original, but some things could still be easier.
    - The shortcuts on the home page would be nice, but the links are broken.
    - I have to dig and do some math to find the deadlines for registration in 2020.
    - I have to dig and do some math to find the deadlines for absentee voting in 2020.

2) Are the pages reasonably structured with HTML?
    - For the most part, yes.
    - The home page isn't called index.html, which is the traditional name.
    - The Vote page is a little lengthy and could use a bit more internal structure.

3) Are the pages tolerably styled with Bootstrap?
    - Yes.
